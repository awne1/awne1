        <p>  <h3>Advantages of Cruise voyages:</h3>
            
            <div class="everestQualities">1-Less Planning</div><p>All the work is done for you, your food, your drinks and your activities(whatever your age is). Although most of your food and drinks are covered, not all are, to illustrate more your main meals and some beverages included are covered, but Snacks and extra beverages are not covered(especially alcoholic beverages). There are two solutions for this problem: first eat a big meal so you don't need snacks and second if you like to drink lots of beverages then buy a beverage package.</p>
                <div class="everestQualities">2-You Can See More Places</div><p>Unlike a resort, which is fixed in one location, a cruise ship will allow you to visit at least five destinations.</p>
            <div class="everestQualities">3-More Activities On the Cruise</div><p>The activities you spend time doing at a resort is usually less than the activities you can do on a board of the cruise ship for example you can have massages, play ping pong in a tournment and watch movies in a cinema.</p>
                
                <div class="everestQualities">4-Meeting new people</div><p>You can meet new people at the buffet-style eating areas and planned group activities. Also if you are single then single cruises is a great way for the uncoupled to have a great time and meet a partner.</p>
            
            
     
                        
 <h3>Disadvantages of Cruise voyages:</h3>
          <div class="everestQualities"> 1-Hidden Costs</div> <p>
                -You cannot use cash or your own credit card on the cruise ship. Instead, the cruise line will give you a special card to use, linked to your own credit card. Every time you want to buy an alcoholic drink or visit the spa, you swipe the cruise line's card. It is extremely easy to forget that you're using your own money and go overboard with these cards.<br>
                -The cruise line will have a travel agency set up on the ship where you can book excursion trips. While this is the easiest way to do it, it's also costly. You could spend several thousands of dollars taking sightseeing trips in port. <br>
                -Tipping, While you're on the ship, 100 different people will wait on you. In your room, you will have maid service. In the dining area, you will have one primary server, a wine server, and several other waiters working your table. The cruise line also offers concierge services, travel agents, photographers, bartenders, casino dealers, and room service. While it's not officially required, you are expected to tip at least some of these people.</p>
            
                
                <div class="everestQualities">2-Travelling with children</div><p>Some cruise like Disney Cruises  are best for families, On the Other hand there are cruises like the Royal Caribbean which are better for singles. While every cruise line has some activities for middle aged children, not all cruises have activities for young children. To conclude, you need to be careful which kind of cruise you will choose if you have young children so that they don't get bored on the second day, and remember that bored children means tough time for adults. </p>
                
            <div class="everestQualities">3-Time limits</div><p>If you like to explore every corner in the place you go to then you won't probably enjoy your cruise vacation beacause you will have to return from the cruise's destination to the cruise at dusk . To conclude you will spend twelve hours at max on your destination, so you won't be able to explore every place. </p>
                
            <div class="everestQualities">4-Sea Sickness</div><p>Although a cruise ship is 20k-60k tons the ocean can sometimes hit it hard (especially during storms) which can cause sea sickness for many people. You should take a voyage on a boat in sea for a day as a test before you get on a cruise ship because the last place you want to realize that your stomach can't take waves is 50-miles offshore with 6 days left on your vacation. </p>
