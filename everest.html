            They are constantly developing their operational systems to ensure you participate in the best expedition available on the market. In the interests of giving you the highest chance to summit, they limit their team size to make sure the group summits on the best weather day; sometimes there is only one summit day! Large teams offering cheap climbs often miss out as they split their groups over several potential summit days.

               Budget Considerations:
               </div>
            <p>
            There are a lot of people out there who call themselves guides yet are really just people wanting you to pay for their holiday. Choose a guide who is appropriately qualified and see if someone you know can recommend a guide they have knowledge of or experience with. The type of objective has a lot to do with the type of guide you need; a quick ascent of the Matterhorn is not going to have the same demands as a 3 month expedition to Mt Everest. There is a reason that established guides or guiding companies have the reputation that they have, it’s because there is sufficient information out there about their previous track records and modus operandus. Be very aware to not base your decision about a guide or guiding company on price alone, cheap means cheap, and nowhere more than with a guiding service. After all, would you shop around for the cheapest dentist or doctor before having surgery done?<br></p>

             The Early Years:
               </div>
             <p>
           During their 1992 expedition, 12 people summited, and in 1993, eight people stood with us on top of the world. Their 1994 expedition was marked by 10 successful summiters, with Peter Athans attaining the summit for his fourth time, a record for western climbers at the time.

The 1996 season was marred by storms, and their team was at the forefront of numerous rescues, assisting endangered climbers from other expeditions. Lead guides Todd Burleson and Peter Athans climbed to 26,000 ft. to rescue climbers, for which they were awarded the American Alpine Club’s prestigious Sowles Award. Their team made a valiant second attempt at the summit, but harsh winds turned them back.

From 1997 to 1999, their guides were involved in high-altitude research; their team worked in conjunction with the Boston Museum of Science in the installation of GPS equipment designed to measure the increasing height of Everest. Their 2000 Everest expedition was certainly one of their finest teams, led by Vern Tejas and Willi Prittie, who extended our unsurpassed safety record.
