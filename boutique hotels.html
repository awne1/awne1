        <h3>Advantages Of Boutique Hotels:</h3>
           <div class="everestQualities">1-A home away from home</div>
           <p>You will feel at home;A boutique hotel can offer anywhere between 25 to over 100 rooms to its guests. This allows them to enjoy a more cozy experience that lacks the vastness of a chain hotel.</p>
           
           <div class="everestQualities">2-Personalized</div>
           <p>Boutique hotels offer personalized experience as they have their own style for example some of them were historic buildings that were turned into hotels while others are decorated with animals' skin.</p>
           
           <div class="everestQualities">3-Helpful Staff</div>
           <p>the service is very friendly and helpful.</p>
           
           <div class="everestQualities">4-Inside Cities</div>
           Boutique Hotels are generally well integrated into cities and the surrounds in great locations from which to meet locals and really get under the skin of your destination.
           
           <h3>Disadvantages Of Boutique Hotels</h3>
           
           <p>You don’t have the luxury of having all the services and facilities that you might need in one place. Many have gyms, spas and restaurants on site, but most do not, encouraging you to branch out and explore your new surroundings – the knowledgeable staff, however, are most times happy to help organise tours for you.</p>
